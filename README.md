Misspell Fixer
==============

Utility to fix common misspellings in source codes. There are lots of typical misspellings in program codes.
Typically they are more eye-catching in the living code but they can easily hide in comments, examples, samples, notes and documentations.
With this utility you can fix a large number of them very quickly.

Be aware that the utility does not check or fix file names. It can easily happen that a misspelled word is fixed in a file name in a program's code, but
the file itself will not be renamed by this utility.

And also important to note to be extra careful when fixing public APIs!

A manual review is always needed to verify that nothing has been broken.

### Synopsis
    
    misspell_fixer	[OPTION] ...target directories...

### Options

* `-d` Debug mode: shows the core logics all steps
* `-v` Verbose mode: shows the iterated files
* `-r` Real run mode: Overwrites the original files with the fixed one. Without this option the originals will be untouched.
* `-f` Fast mode: Faster mode with limited options. (`-v`, `-s` options are not supported) Works only with real run mode `-r`. This mode cannot make backups. (`-n` is also needed)
* `-s` Shows diffs of changes.
* `-i` Walk through source code management system's internal directories. (don't ignore `*.svn*`, `*.git*`)
* `-n` Disabling backups. (By default the modified files' originals will be saved with the `.$$.BAK` suffix.)
* `-u` Enabling less safe rules. (Manual revise's need will be more probable.)
* `-h` Help. Displays this page.

### Sample usages

By default nothing import will happen

    $ misspell_fixer.sh targetdir

What you can track with -v

    $ misspell_fixer.sh -v targetdir

A real usage:

    $ misspell_fixer.sh -r -v targetdir

Show only the diff, don't modify the files:

    $ misspell_fixer.sh -s -v targetdir

Show everything and fix the files:

    $ misspell_fixer.sh -r -s -v targetdir

Fast mode example:

    $ misspell_fixer.sh -r -f -n targetdir
